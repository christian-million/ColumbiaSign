# The Sign Out Front

The VP of Instruction asked Joe to solve the following problem:

Assume the sign cycles every 20 seconds, you can see and read the sign at the top of the hill for approximately 60 seconds (normal distribution, sd of 5), and there are 20 slides. What percentage of the slides will a student see if they come to school 4 days a week?

## Goals

- Write a script using a circular linked list to answer this question with some simulations.

- Take user input for these numbers.

## Reach Goals

- Keep settings in a json file, load defaults but let the user change them.

- Does the answer to this question change if they're randomly selected rather than on a cycle?
